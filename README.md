# supertrend_telegram_bot
This bot can sends Supertrend signals of selected crypto/stock symbols as a Telegram message

In this project there is two different Python scripts for crypto market and stock market. You can use which one you want to work with. 

USAGE:

After you create a Telegram bot with BotFather, you should fill telegram_bot_token and telegram_chat_id parts in the script correctly.

If you have a Tradingview account, you can fill specified parts in the script about that. If you do that, bot will work better and you won't get possible limit errors.

I recommend writing maximum of 12 symbols to avoid getting a limit error for using without a Tradingview account. If you use more, you can do this with another for loop and another symbol list. But don't overdo it.

And finally don't forget to modify the symbol list to your favourites symbols.
