⚠️ First of all this project and the bot created after this project doesn't include any financial advice. The bot created after this project just scan selected crypto/stock symbols for Supertrend indicator and send signals as a Telegram message.

In this project there is two different Python scripts for crypto market and stock market. You can use which one you want to work with.

⚡ Running these scripts automatically and regularly in a cloud (e.g. AWS) is the most efficient outcome of this project.

❓ USAGE:

After you create a Telegram bot with BotFather, you should fill telegram_bot_token and telegram_chat_id parts in the script correctly.

If you have a Tradingview account, you can fill specified parts in the script about that. If you do that, bot will work better and you won't get possible limit errors.

I recommend writing maximum of 12 symbols to avoid getting a limit error for using without a Tradingview account. If you want use it with more symbols, you can do this with another for loop and another symbol list. But don't overdo it.

And finally don't forget to modify the symbol list to your favourites symbols.
